# **Adaptive Learning MVP**

A lightweight prototype designed to make learning more accessible—especially for **students in rural areas**.

## 📘 Overview

This project is an **Adaptive Learning MVP** that tailors educational content based on a student’s grade, chapter, and progress.
It focuses on **offline-friendly access**, **simple UI**, and **personalized lessons**, helping bridge the learning gap for students who may not have consistent internet or advanced devices.
